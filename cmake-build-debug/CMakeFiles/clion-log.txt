  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findproject_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "project_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "project_interface"
  with any of the following names:

    project_interfaceConfig.cmake
    project_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "project_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "project_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "project_interface" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
